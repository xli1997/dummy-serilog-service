To write a simple HTTP GET request using curl++ 8.8.0_2 in a Visual C++ application for Windows, you'll need to follow these steps:

Set up your development environment: Ensure you have curl++ and its dependencies installed. You can usually get these via vcpkg or another package manager.

Include the necessary headers: Add the necessary curl headers in your Visual C++ project.

Write the code for the HTTP GET request: Use the curl++ library to perform the GET request.

Here's a step-by-step example of how to do this:

Step 1: Install cURL++ Library
Make sure to install the cURL library and cURL++ wrapper. You can do this using vcpkg:

sh
Copy code
vcpkg install curlpp
Step 2: Set Up Visual Studio Project
Open Visual Studio and create a new Console Application project.
Configure the project to include the cURL and curl++ libraries and headers.
Link the cURL and curl++ libraries in your project settings.
Step 3: Include Necessary Headers
In your main .cpp file, include the necessary headers:

cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <curl/curl.h>
#include <curlpp/cURLpp.hpp>
#include <curlpp/Options.hpp>
Step 4: Write the Code for HTTP GET Request
Here's a complete example of performing a simple HTTP GET request:

cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <sstream>
#include <curl/curl.h>
#include <curlpp/cURLpp.hpp>
#include <curlpp/Options.hpp>
#include <curlpp/Easy.hpp>

static size_t WriteCallback(void* contents, size_t size, size_t nmemb, void* userp)
{
    ((std::string*)userp)->append((char*)contents, size * nmemb);
    return size * nmemb;
}

int main()
{
    try
    {
        // Initialize cURLpp
        curlpp::Cleanup myCleanup;

        // Define the URL
        std::string url = "http://www.example.com";

        // Create a cURLpp::Easy object
        curlpp::Easy myRequest;

        // Set the URL option
        myRequest.setOpt(curlpp::options::Url(url));

        // Create a string to hold the response data
        std::string responseString;
        std::ostringstream responseStream;

        // Set the write function callback
        myRequest.setOpt(new curlpp::options::WriteFunction(curlpp::types::WriteFunctionFunctor([&responseString](char* ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb) {
            responseString.append(ptr, size * nmemb);
            return size * nmemb;
        })));

        // Perform the request
        myRequest.perform();

        // Output the response
        std::cout << "Response: " << responseString << std::endl;
    }
    catch (curlpp::LogicError& e)
    {
        std::cerr << "LogicError: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }
    catch (curlpp::RuntimeError& e)
    {
        std::cerr << "RuntimeError: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
Explanation
Initialization: curlpp::Cleanup myCleanup initializes cURLpp and ensures cleanup is done automatically.

Set URL: The myRequest.setOpt(curlpp::options::Url(url)) sets the URL for the request.

Response Handling: A lambda function is used to handle the response data. The WriteFunction option is set to capture the response data into a string.

Perform the Request: The myRequest.perform() performs the actual GET request.

Error Handling: The code includes basic error handling for cURLpp logic and runtime errors.

Build and Run
Make sure to link against the cURL and cURLpp libraries.
Build the project in Visual Studio.
Run the executable to see the output of the HTTP GET request.
This example demonstrates a simple HTTP GET request using cURLpp in a Visual C++ application. Ensure your development environment is correctly set up with the necessary libraries and paths.
