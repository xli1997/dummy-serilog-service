Here are the detailed steps to set up a scheduled task in Windows Server 2019 to run a program (A.exe) using a service account at 6:00 AM:

Step 1: Prepare the Service Account
Ensure Service Account Permissions:

The service account you intend to use must have the necessary permissions to run the task.
Verify it has "Log on as a batch job" rights:
Open Local Security Policy → Security Settings → Local Policies → User Rights Assignment.
Find Log on as a batch job, add the service account.
Ensure Access to A.exe:

Confirm the service account has permission to execute A.exe and access any required files or resources.

Step 2: Open Task Scheduler
Log in to the server with administrative credentials.
Open Task Scheduler:
Press Win + S, type Task Scheduler, and press Enter.

Step 3: Create a New Task
In Task Scheduler, select Create Task from the right-hand Actions pane.
Fill in the General tab:
Name: Enter a descriptive name (e.g., Run A.exe Daily).
Description: Optionally, provide a brief description.
Security options:
Select Run whether user is logged on or not.
Check Run with highest privileges.
Change User or Group: Click this button, enter the service account name, and click OK.

Step 4: Set the Trigger
Go to the Triggers tab and click New.
Configure the trigger:
Begin the task: Select On a schedule.
Settings: Choose Daily and set the start time to 6:00:00 AM.
Ensure Enabled is checked.
Click OK to save the trigger.

Step 5: Set the Action
Go to the Actions tab and click New.
Configure the action:
Action: Select Start a program.
Program/script: Browse or type the full path to A.exe.
Add arguments (optional): If your program requires arguments, enter them here.
Start in (optional): Specify the directory where A.exe is located (optional but recommended).
Click OK to save the action.

Step 6: Configure Additional Settings
Go to the Conditions tab:
Adjust power or idle conditions if necessary. For servers, you might want to uncheck Start the task only if the computer is on AC power.
Go to the Settings tab:
Check Allow task to be run on demand.
Set If the task fails, restart every to retry if it fails.
Ensure Stop the task if it runs longer than has an appropriate value, or uncheck it if the task duration is indefinite.

Step 7: Save and Test the Task
Click OK to save the task.
When prompted, enter the password for the service account.
Test the task:
In Task Scheduler, right-click the task and select Run.
Verify the program executes correctly.

Step 8: Verify Task Execution
Check the History tab of the task to ensure it ran successfully.
Verify logs or outputs of A.exe to confirm the desired results.
This setup ensures that A.exe will run every day at 6:00 AM under the service account with the specified credentials.
